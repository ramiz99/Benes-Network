Chains-Single-Layer.py
	a python code to measure the number of loops and the length of
	loops within a single layer of a Benes network. This is for
	100% input loads.

Chains-Partial-Perm.py
	a python code to measure the number of loops and the length of
	loops within a single layer of a Benes network. This is for 
	different input loads.
